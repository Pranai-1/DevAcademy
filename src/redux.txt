step 1:-
create a store and then export it,wrap the store inside Provider with the whole application.
configureStore() is the method which helps to create the store,and that is imported from @reduxjs/toolkit 
while Provider is imported from react-redux

step 2:-
create the slice using createSlice() method and it is imported from @reduxjs/toolkit
while creating the slice:-
** pass the name of the slice as first index name:"cart"
** initial state which is an object
** we write reducer functions inside a reducers named key which is also an object reducers:{}
** The methods inside reducers object will have two parameters 1.state 2.action.These methods helps to update the state
** we need to export our actions and reducers using cartSlice.actions and cartSlice.reducer not reducers
** state has default access so need to pass this as an argument while invoking reducer functions,we need to pass 
** the updated state which will be accessed as action.payload
**  dispatch(setCart(cart.cartCourses))//we pass reducer function inside which we pass updated state

Every slice has their own reducers functions and our app has a reducer function which contains all those reducers
In the configureStore() method pass an object with a reducer field having a value of cartReducer which has been 
exported by cartSlice.reducer,make sure cartSlice.reducer has default export in cartSlice.js file

we need to pass objects inside configureStore and createSlice()

To trigger those reducer functions,we need to use useDispatch() hook which is imported from react-redux
To access the value of the state,we need to use useSelector() hook which is imported from react-redux
